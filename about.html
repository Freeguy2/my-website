            <p>LeBron James is widely regarded as one of the best players in basketball today. He has an incredible combination of skills, strength, leaping ability, and height that make him one of the best athletes in the world.Source: The White House.LeBron James was born in Akron, Ohio on December 30, 1984. He grew up in Akron where he had a difficult childhood. His father was an ex-con who wasn't there when he grew up. His family was poor and had a tough time. Fortunately, his basketball coach, Frankie Walker, took LeBron under his wing and let him stay with his family where he could get away from the projects and focus on school and basketball.LeBron went to high school at St. Vincent - St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. He led his basketball team to three state titles and was named "Mr. Basketball" in Ohio for three straight years. He decided not to go to college and went straight to the NBA where he was the number 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft.LeBron was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers where he played his first seven seasons. Since he grew up just down the road at Akron, Ohio he was considered a home town superstar and maybe the biggest star ever in Cleveland. However, despite LeBron's excellence on the court, the team was unable to win a championship.In 2010, LeBron became a free agent. This meant he could go play for any team he wanted. Which team he would choose was big news. ESPN even had a whole show called "The Decision" where LeBron told the world that he was going to play for the Miami Heat next. During his four years with the Miami Heat, LeBron led the Heat to the NBA championship finals every year, winning the championship twice. In 2014, LeBron moved back to Cleveland. He wanted to bring a championship to his home town. </p>

                <p>Spalding was the first company to produce a basketball for official use. Spalding is the official ball of the NBA and has made the genuine leather.Basketballs have evolved considerably since the game was invented. Today, technology has made ball performance and quality relatively uniform. This wasn't always the case, as basketballs have undergone many changes and improvements from the original soccer ball that was used for the first two years of the sport's existence. History For the first two years after Dr. James Naismith invented basketball in 1891, soccer balls were used as the balls. In 1894, the first basketball was manufactured and made of laced leather. The molded version of a basketball was invented in 1948 and for about 50 years almost all basketballs were made of genuine leather. In the early 1990s, the first balls made of high-tech composite leathers began to appear. The NBA switched to a composite leather design in 2006, but the changes lasted only three months because of a barrage of complaints from players.</p>
